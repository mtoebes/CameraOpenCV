# CameraOpenCV

The purpose of this Application is to allow us to access the camera in order to take and save images to file.
Once saved, we can perform several image processing techniques to parse information about the image such as identifying colors and lines. 

This project makes use of the OpenCV library to perform matrix operations that are normally very complicated to write in native java.
